## Welcome to Cangjia

This is the home the Cangjians, a team of [people](people.html) passionate
about Free Software, and dedicated to the
[Cangjie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method) and
[Quick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Cangjie) input methods.

In here, you will find some informations about our Free Software projects:

* [libcangjie2](/projects/libcangjie2/), the library implementing the
  Cangjie input method

* [pycangjie](/projects/pycangjie/), the Python bindings to libcangjie2

* [IBus Cangjie](/projects/ibus-cangjie/), the IBus engine for users of the
  Cangjie and Quick input methods

Everything we do is Free Software. This is because we respect your Freedom,
and because working together in the open allows us to to provide you with the
best possible input experience: you don't have to be "just a user", you can
[help us](contribute.html) make it work better for you.

If there's anything we can do, be sure to [let us know](contact.html). As
long as it is related to Cangjie, of course ;-)

## What we do

We are dedicated to providing the best possible input experience for Cangjie
and Quick users.

At the moment, we are working on the following projects:

* [libcangjie2](/projects/libcangjie2/) is a library implementing the
  Cangjie method.

  It handles all the mappings between the input codes and the desired
  characters, and provides some filtering options.

* [pycangjie](/projects/pycangjie/) is a Python module wrapping the
  libcangjie2 API.

  It is the bridge between libcangjie2 and IBus Cangjie.

* [IBus Cangjie](/projects/ibus-cangjie/) is the IBus engine for users of
  the Cangjie and Quick input methods.

  It offers a great input experience for IBus users, with sane defaults and
  simple yet important options.

For now, we are mostly targetting the Linux desktop, especially in the IBus
input method framework.

However, we would love to see these projects reused in other platforms, and we
will accept patches necessary to do so.

Additionally, we will happily welcome other Cangjie-related projects under the
Cangjians umbrella!

As libcangjie2 is a Cangjians project, it is subject to our
[general guidelines for contribution](/contribute.html), so be sure to read
them first.

That being said, there are a couple of things which are specific to
libcangjie2.

First of all, it is written in C, so if you want to contribute to the code,
you'll need to know a bit about that.

If you find a bug, please make sure it is not
[already known](https://github.com/Cangjians/libcangjie2/issues), and if not
please [report it](https://github.com/Cangjians/libcangjie2/issues/new).

Of course, when looking at the list of open bugs, if you find one you would
like to fix, just go ahead and send us a pull request.

We love pull requests fixing bugs or implementing new features, especially
when they come along with new unit tests!

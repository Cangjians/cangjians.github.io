This is an IBus engine for users of the Cangjie and Quick input methods.

It is primarily intended to Hong Kong people who want to input Traditional
Chinese, as they are (by far) the majority of Cangjie and Quick users.

However, it should work for others as well (e.g to input Simplified Chinese).

Note that the actual input logic is handled by
[libcangjie](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cangjie/libcangjie).

Development happens [on freedesktop.org](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cangjie/ibus-cangjie),
table release tarballs can be found in
[the releases section](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cangjie/ibus-cangjie/-/releases/) there.

## Let's get in touch

We don't have any dedicated mailing-list or communication channel (yet?), but
it should still be pretty easy to talk to us.

First of all, if you found a problem with our software or this website, then
please [report it](/contribute.html). If you send us an email about a problem
you are encountering, we'll probably just ask you to open a bug report anyway.

However, if you want to discuss about anything related to our team, our
projects, or even the Cangjie input method in general, you can reach us on one
of the following forums.

For **real-time chat**, please please join the [`#cangjie:converser.eu`][matrix-invite-url]
Matrix chatroom, say hi, and just ask about the Project Cangjie, or the specific
project you are interested in. At least Mathieu Bridon (aka
*bochecha*) and Koala Yeung (aka *yookoala*) hang in there all day long, almost
every day.

And if you are in Hong Kong, feel free to use one of the above to get in touch
and organize a real-life meetup over a drink. (*especially if you're inviting!
:P*)

In any case, please remember to **remain polite and patient**. We're humans
too, and we might sometimes be too busy to answer immediately. However, we
promise to try our best to answer within a reasonable time frame.

Of course, we **love** receiving feedback on our software, both good and bad
(as long as it remains polite and constructive), so don't hesitate to contact
us.

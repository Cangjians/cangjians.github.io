## Let's get in touch

We don't have any dedicated mailing-list or communication channel (yet?), but
it should still be pretty easy to talk to us.

First of all, if you found a problem with our software or this website, then
please [report it](/contribute.html). If you send us an email about a problem
you are encountering, we'll probably just ask you to open a bug report anyway.

Now if you want to discuss about anything related to our projects, or even the
Cangjie input method in general, you can use one of the following media.

For real-time chat, join the `#linux-hk` channel on the Freenode IRC network,
and just ask about the Cangjians, or the specific project you are interested
in. At least *bochecha* hangs in there all day long, almost every day.

If you'd rather talk over email, you can write to
[the mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hklug) of the
[Hong Kong Linux User Group](http://www.linux.org.hk/), and start the
conversation over there.

In both case, remember to remain polite and patient. We're humans too, and as
we might sometimes be too busy to answer immediately. We promise to try our
best to answer within a reasonable time frame, though.

In any case, we love to receive feedback on our software, good and bad (as
long as it remains polite and constructive), so don't hesitate to contact us.

IBus Cangjie and its dependencies are made mostly for fun to try and improve
the quality of Traditional Chinese input for Hong Kong users by mostly 2
people for the core develpment team and a handful of contributors who come
and go, mostly when they can provide a simple fix for a bug, or more often by
reporting bugs. Yes, reporting an issue is also a valid contribution!

Like all free software projects, this stack is made out of love in the hope
that it can be useful for our users, and it is all completely free of charge:
we accepted a long time ago we would never become rich from our work, or else
we would have released it under a proprietary licensing scheme or worse, with
patents...

We do not want to ask money from our users, but if some of you can afford it,
we wouldn't be against a voluntary contribution of money.

Our Liberapay page is [here](https://liberapay.com/cangjie), where you can find
how to support our work with a monetary contribution, as low as you can, and as
much as you want. ☺️

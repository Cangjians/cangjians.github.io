## Meet the Cangjians

We are a team of people passionate about Free Software, and dedicated to
providing the best user experience with the Cangjie and Quick input methods.

We try our best to be friendly, we don't bite (*unless you ask nicely :P*), so
feel free to [get in touch](/contact.html).

##### Mathieu Bridon (bochecha)

Mathieu can't even read Chinese. He got sucked into the madness of
implementing Chinese input methods when he tried to figure out how to let his
girlfriend type Chinese on his laptop running Linux.

Now that she actually can, she insists on finding bugs in
[IBus Cangjie](/projects/ibus-cangjie), which keeps Mathieu busy trying to fix
them.
